To allow your antivirus model to scan system files 
and other protected areas, you'll need to make sure the program has the necessary permissions to
access those files, which may be restricted due to Windows security settings.

Steps to Give Permissions for Full System Scan:
1. Run the Program as Administrator
Windows has restrictions on accessing certain system files and folders.
Running the program as an Administrator will grant it the necessary permissions to access protected files
(like C:/pagefile.sys, C:/hiberfil.sys, etc.).

How to Run as Administrator:

Right-click on the Command Prompt or PowerShell shortcut.
Select "Run as administrator".
In the elevated Command Prompt or PowerShell, navigate to your project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd D:\BSCS\PROJECTS\antivirus-main #path to the folder  
Then, run your Python script:
bash
Copy code
python ui_main.py 
This will allow the script to access restricted files while scanning.

2. Grant Access to Specific Files or Folders (User Account Control - UAC)
If you want to give access to specific folders or files to your antivirus model,
you can manually modify the permissions for these files/folders.

Steps to Manually Modify Permissions:

Right-click on the folder (e.g., C:/ or C:/Windows) or file (e.g., C:/pagefile.sys) you want to give access to.
Select Properties.
Go to the Security tab.
Click on Edit to change permissions.
Select the user or group (like Administrator or Everyone) and check Full Control.
Apply the changes.

3. Temporarily Disable Antivirus Software (Optional)
Some antivirus software might block or restrict access to system files, especially when scanning sensitive files.
If you're using a third-party antivirus, try temporarily disabling it during testing to avoid interference. 
Be sure to re-enable it afterward.

4. Allow File Access for Python (Windows Defender SmartScreen)
If Windows Defender is blocking access to certain files, you may need to adjust Windows Defender settings to 
allow your Python program to run without restrictions.

How to Allow Access for Python:

Open Windows Security from the Start Menu.
Click on Virus & Threat Protection.
Scroll down and click Manage Settings under "Virus & Threat Protection Settings".
Under Controlled Folder Access, make sure itâ€™s turned off, or add your Python script as an allowed program.

5. Using Elevated Privileges for Specific Files
If you're trying to access specific system files like C:/pagefile.sys or C:/hiberfil.sys, 
and you're getting permission errors, you might need to run the Python script in administrator mode or 
use a method like Windows Task Scheduler to run the script with elevated permissions automatically.


Quick Summary:
Run the script as Administrator: Right-click on the Command Prompt and select "Run as administrator".
Modify file permissions: For specific folders or files, modify permissions to grant access (full control).
Adjust antivirus/defender settings: Temporarily disable or adjust your antivirus software to prevent blocking of files.
Disable Windows Defender SmartScreen (optional): If it's blocking files, adjust the security settings accordingly.

Using a Shortcut for Administrator Privileges
If you frequently run the script and want to avoid manually opening Command Prompt or PowerShell each time:

Create a Shortcut:

Locate your Python script (ui_main.py).
Right-click on it and select Create Shortcut.
Edit the Shortcut:

Right-click on the shortcut and select Properties.
In the Target field, add the path to your Python executable followed by the script. For example:
swift
Copy code
"C:\Path\to\python.exe" "D:\BSCS\PROJECTS\antivirus-main\ui_main.py"
Click OK to save changes.
Run as Administrator:

Right-click on the shortcut and select Properties.
Go to the Shortcut tab and click Advanced.
Check the box for Run as administrator.
Click OK.
Now, double-clicking the shortcut will automatically run the script as Administrator.
